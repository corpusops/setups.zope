# Zope app

## Corpusops doc (deployment)

### Setup variables
```sh
export A_GIT_URL="git@gitlab.makina-corpus.net:foo/bar.git"
export COPS_CWD="$HOME/makina/<your project>"
export NONINTERACTIVE=1
# VM NOT DONE
export FTP_URL=<tri>@ftp.makina-corpus.net:/srv/projects/makina_commun/data/commun/nobackup/vm_bar/*-*box
```
### Clone the project
- Note the **--recursive** switch; if you follow the next commands, you can then skip this step on the next docs.

    ```sh
    git clone --recursive $A_GIT_URL $COPS_CWD
    git submodule update
    .ansible/scripts/download_corpusops.sh
    .ansible/scripts/setup_ansible.sh
    ```

### Deploy the dev VM
- [corpusops vagrant doc](https://github.com/corpusops/corpusops.bootstrap/blob/master/docs/projects/vagrant.md)<br/>
  or ``local/corpusops.bootstrap/docs/projects/vagrant.md`` after corpusops.bootstrap download.

### Deploy on enviromnents
- Setup needed when you dont have Ci setup for doing it for you
- [corpusops deploy doc](https://github.com/corpusops/corpusops.bootstrap/blob/master/docs/projects/deploy.md)<br/>
  or ``local/corpusops.bootstrap/docs/projects/deploy.md`` after corpusops.bootstrap download.


## Exemple of a generic plone portal deployment

### Add you own sources
- Generate a Plone add-on with mr.bob
- Replace src/test with your generated addon src/ content
- Replace setup.py with the generated version
- Change the `mainegg` value in ./etc/sys/settings.cfg

### OVERRIDE DEFAULT SETTINGS
- On the first checkout you need to create ``etc/sys/settings-local.cfg``/
- You can either create an empty file or copy ``etc/sys/settings.cfg`` and adapt it to your needs.
- Edit the etc/sys/settings-local.cfg file.
```
etc/sys
|
|-- settings.cfg       -> various common settings (crons hours, hosts, installation paths, ports, passwords)
`-- settings-local.cfg -> override locally the common settings (do not commit the file)
```
### PRODUCTION MODE
- To make your application safe for production, run the ``buildout-prod.cfg`` buildout'.
- It extends this one with additionnal crontabs and backup scripts and some additionnal instances creation.

### BASE BUILDOUTS WHICH DO ONLY SCHEDULE PARTS FROM THERE & THERE
```
|-- etc/base.cfg               -> The base buildout
|-- buildout-prod.cfg          -> buildout for production
|-- buildout-dev.cfg           -> buildout for development
```

### PROJECT Files
- Think you have the most important sections of this buildout configuration in etc/cgwb.cfg
Set the project developement  specific settings there
```
etc/project/
|-- plone.cfg       -> your project needs (packages, sources, product, version spinngss)
|-- versions.cfg    -> your project version pinnings (KGS)
`-- kgs.cfg         -> autogenerated to be manual merged in your project version pinngs.
```

### SYSTEM ADMINISTRATORS RELATED FILES
```
etc/sys/
|-- ha.cfg           -> Project loadbalancer settings
|-- supervisor.cfg   -> Project production settings for supervision
|-- system.cfg       -> Project settings (backup)

```

### Static build procedure
```
git checkout prod
git reset --hard origin prod
git merge master
git yarn build # or whatever to build static
# make sure gulp is running, so theme/front is regenerated)
git commit -am "update assets"
git push origin prod:prod
```

**IMPORTANT**: never merge prod in master (as master ignore theme/map, but prod does not)


## USE/Install With makina-states (mostly obsolete)
- Iniatilise on the target platform the project if it is not already done
```sh
salt mc_project.init_project name=<foo>
```

- Keep under the hood both remotes (pillar & project).
- Clone the project pillar remote inside your project top directory
- Add/Relace your salt deployment code inside **.salt** inside your repository.
- Add the project remote
    - replace remotenickname with a sensible name (eg: prod)::
    - replace the_project_remote_given_in_init with the real url
    - Run the following commands::

        ```sh
        git remote add <remotenickname>  <the_project_remote_given_in_init>
        git fetch --all
        ```

- Each time you need to deploy from your computer, run::
    ```sh
    cd pillar
    git push [--force] <remotenickname> <yourlocalbranch(eg: master,prod,whatever)>:master
    cd ..
    git push [--force] <remotenickname> <yourlocalbranch(eg: master,prod,whatever)>:master
    ```

- Notes:
    - The distant branch is always *master**
    - If you force the push, the local working copy of the remote deployed site
      will be resetted to the TIP changeset your are pushing.

- If you want to install locally on the remote computer, or test it locally and
  do not want to run the full deployement procedure, when you are on a shell
  (connected via ssh on the remote computer or locally on your box), run::
    ```sh
    salt mc_project.deploy only=install,fixperms
    ```
- You can also run just specific step(s)::
    ```sh
    salt mc_project.deploy only=install,fixperms only_steps=000_whatever
    salt mc_project.deploy only=install,fixperms only_steps=000_whatever,001_else
    ```
- If you want to commit in prod and then push back from the remote computer, remember
  to push on the right branch, eg::
    ```sh
    git remote add github https://github.com/orga/repo.git
    git fetch --all
    git push github master:prod
    ```
